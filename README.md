 ### AIM: 
 To understand the standard procedure to interface an FPGA board and flashing method using usb blaster 
### HARDWARE REQUIRED:  â€“ 
PC, Cyclone II , USB flasher
### SOFTWARE REQUIRED:   
Quartus prime
### THEORY 
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are semiconductor devices that are based around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected via programmable interconnects. FPGAs can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing.
### Procedure 
#### Start the Quartus II Programmer.
